# BankAccount

Banking program that opens savings and checking accounts, making a pair of test deposits and withdrawals into those accounts.  After the
user finishes opening accounts, the program performs monthly maintenance on those accounts:  adding interest to savings accounts and
deducting transaction fees from checking accounts.  Finally, it prints out all bank accounts in sorted order from highest to lowest by 
balance.
